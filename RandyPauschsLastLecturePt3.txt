2022-11-29

Key takeaways:
 * Live life genuienly and honestly and good things will happen
 * Stay curious and work hard, don''t look at things as impossible hurdles, 
   just temporary setbacks

 * None of this matters unless I take it to heart


Jokes:

Notes:
 * When he had this assignment last year, I wasn't sure as to why it was K39 and not HW39, 
   but after becoming a devo, I think I understand now. Having it be HW42 now feels like a 
   reminder that this video is timeless and anyone can learn from it. 
 * In response to the elephant comment- Make an enviornment that's comfortable when you're doing anything
 * "I couldn't find any pictures of me when I was not smiling"- I experienced the same thing the other 
    day when my parents where looking through baby photos of me. I was rarely ever not smiling and that 
    made me question why I don't smile as much now (or at least it feels like I don't)
 * "The inspriation and permission to dream is huge" 
 * "It's importnat to have specifc dreams" - I think this makes them wasier to achieve but also easier to 
    keep sight of. I have a dream/goal that I want to work towards but I feel like I loose sight of it
    quickly
 * "Brick walls are there for a reason: they let us prove how badly we want things- obsticals should never
    be something that stops us
 * Just because you don't achienve your dreams doesn't mean you can't learn from the experience
 * "When you screw up and no one's telling you, that means they've given up"
 * Most of what we learn, we learn indirectly, or by head fake
 * Sometimes dreams need to be altered 
 * It's cool to meet you idol but cooler for them to come see what you've been doing in your lab
 * Even the smallest of dreams deserve to de achieved
 * Brick walls are there to stop *other* people, not us 
 * Made a VR machine in about $5,000
 * Two birds and one stone seems to be a reoccuring theme
 * "We'll work it out"
 * Give people a little more time and they will almost always surprise you
 * They way you say things makes a HUGE difference
 * Become a professor- you can have your cake and eat it 
 * The structure of Building Virtual Worlds reminds me of the soft dev structure
 * Find the bar- don't just put it somewhere
 * Good team culture leads to success 
 * If you do something pioneering, you're going to get arrows in your back
 * Find joy in the experiences you have and the people you work with
 * Self reflection is important
 * "You might as well be selling something like education"
 * "I'm dying and I'm having fun. And I'm going to keep having fun, everyday I have left."
 * Are you a tigger or an Eeyore
 * Don't loose your childlike curiosity 
 * Loyalty is a two way street 
 * when men are romantically interested in you, ignore what they say and look at what they do
 * There are moments that change your life- its a gift to be able to know them
 * Earnest > Hip
 * Apologize when you screw up
 * Get a feedback loop and listen to it -> cherish critisism
 * Don't complain, work hard, find the best in people
